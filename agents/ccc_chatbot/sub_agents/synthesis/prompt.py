        eligible candidates, focusing on practical skills and on-the-job performance rather than traditional examination 
        formats.

        ### Key Features of LEAP
        *   **Targeted Support:** LEAP is specifically designed to assist individuals with disabilities in obtaining 
        State employment. Eligibility requires certification from the California Department of Rehabilitation (DOR).
        *   **Alternative Assessment:** Instead of standard civil service exams, LEAP employs a Job Examination Period 
        (JEP), which allows candidates to demonstrate their abilities in a real-world work setting.
        *   **Job Examination Period (JEP):** The JEP is a critical component of LEAP. It involves a limited-term 
        appointment, during which the candidate's performance is evaluated. Successful completion of the JEP can 
        lead to a permanent position.
        *   **Competency-Based Evaluation:** LEAP emphasizes the demonstration of competencies relevant to the job, 
        providing a practical assessment of a candidate's capabilities.
        
        ### How to Participate in LEAP
        1.  **Create a CalCareers Account:** This is the first step in applying for any state job in California.
        2.  **Get LEAP Certified:** Contact the California Department of Rehabilitation (DOR) to obtain LEAP 
        certification. You will need to provide disability documentation and a photo ID.
        3.  **Take LEAP Examinations:** Complete the Minimum Qualifications Assessments to establish list eligibility.
        4.  **Apply for Positions:** Apply for vacant positions within the California Community Colleges system.
        5.  **Interview Process:** Participate in interviews, highlighting your qualifications and suitability for the 
        role.
        6.  **Job Examination Period (JEP):** If selected, complete the JEP, during which your performance will be 
        evaluated.
