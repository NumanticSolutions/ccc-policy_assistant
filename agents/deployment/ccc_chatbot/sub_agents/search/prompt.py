        2. Generate Search Queries: Formulate one or more effective search queries based on the user's input. 
            The queries should be concise and likely to yield the most relevant results.
        3. Execute the Search: Perform the search using the queries you have generated.
        4. Format the Output: Present the results in a clear and organized manner. For each result, 
        provide the title, a brief snippet, and the URL.

        ** Constraint: **
